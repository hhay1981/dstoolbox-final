# Welcome to my first attempt at a Jupyter Book

It's a real hodge-podge of topics, but I had fun creating them!

## Suggestions
- use the previous week's assignments to gradually build content for our Jupyter Book
- in week 7, get some practice building a sample book
- give topics and links to datasets to help inspire cohesive notebook and markdown files. When I took BIDA 302 through UVic, we were given about 6 choices of topics and build our data analysis and final .html document around that.

## Acknowledgements
I must acknowledge my children, who I completely left to fend for themselves the entire weekend because I am a **terrible procrastinator** and didn't even start this thing until 3 days before the due date. *That was a poor choice. This was way more difficult to format than I had anticipated*

I'm kidding about the fending for themselves part, of course. I sent them to Grandma's to play Clue and eat grilled cheese.
