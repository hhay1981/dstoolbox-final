    "It is recommended to only use water conditioners that say “Sodium Thiosulfate” on the Bottle in the Ingredients List as they are very safe to use with fish. The reaction of chlorine (“chlorine” is typically added to water as sodium hypochlorite) with sodium thiosulfate is:<br><br>\n",

    "Let's say you have one betta fish at 3 inches and 6 black neon tetras at 1.5 inches, like I do. This is the calculation you'd do to find the minimum volume of water your aquarium needs to hold: <br>\n",
